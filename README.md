# Installing Husky
1.) Follow the [Conventional Commits Guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
2.) Install `husky`: `npx husky-init && npm install`
3.) Install `commitlint`: `npm install @commitlint/{cli,config-conventional}`
4.) Tell Husky to run `commitlint`:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx --no-install commitlint --edit "$1"
```
5.) Create `.commitlintrc.json`:
```bash
{
  "extends": ["@commitlint/config-conventional"]
}
```
6.) Set script `husky install` and prepare to install the husky Git hook: `npm pkg set scripts.scriptname="husky install"`

7.) Test making a bad commit such as `git add . ; git commit -m "this is a bad commit". If it is working properly, npm should reject the commit with reasons.
