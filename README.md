# Installing Husky
1.) Follow the [Conventional Commits Guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

2.) Install `husky`:
```md
npx husky-init && npm install
```

3.) Install `commitlint`:
```md
npm install @commitlint/{cli,config-conventional}
```

4.) Tell Husky to run `commitlint`:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx --no-install commitlint --edit "$1"
```

5.) Create `.commitlintrc.json` in the root directory of the project folder:
```bash
{
  "extends": ["@commitlint/config-conventional"]
}
```

6.) Set script `husky install` and prepare to install the husky Git hook: 
```md
npm pkg set scripts.scriptname="husky install"
```

7.) Test making a bad commit such as `git add . ; git commit -m "this is a bad commit". If it is working properly, npm should reject the commit with reasons.

# Configuring Semantic Versioning and Automatic Changelog Generator

1.) Install `standard-version`
```md
npm i --save-dev standard-version
```

2.) Add the following declarations in the `"scripts"` rule of `package.json`:
```json
  "scripts": {
    "release": "standard-version",
    "release:minor": "standard-version --release-as minor",
    "release:patch": "standard-version --release-as patch",
    "release:major": "standard-version --release-as major"
  },
```

3.) Create a `.versionrc.json` file in the root directory:
```json
{
  "types": [
    {"type": "feat", "section": "Features"},
    {"type": "fix", "section": "Bug Fixes"},
    {"type": "chore", "hidden": true},
    {"type": "docs", "hidden": true},
    {"type": "style", "hidden": true},
    {"type": "refactor", "hidden": true},
    {"type": "perf", "hidden": true},
    {"type": "test", "hidden": true}
  ],
  "commitUrlFormat": "https://github.com/gentlegiantdev/Noodle-n/commits/{{hash}}",
  "compareUrlFormat": "https://github.com/gentlegiantdev/Noodle-n/compare/{{previousTag}}...{{currentTag}}"
}
  
```

4.) Now it's time to release the new patch! There are 4 common situations:

a.) First release: run `npm run release -- --first-release`:
```md
â–¶ npm run release -- --first-release

> changelog-generator-demo@0.0.0 release /Users/mhoffman/workspace/changelog-generator-demo
> standard-version "--first-release"

âœ– skip version bump on first release
âœ” created CHANGELOG.md
âœ” outputting changes to CHANGELOG.md
âœ” committing CHANGELOG.md
âœ” tagging release v0.0.0
â„¹ Run `git push --follow-tags origin master` to publish
```

b.) Bug Fix patches after using a `fix: ` commit:
```md
â–¶ npm run release:patch
```

c.) Minor patches after using a `feat: ` commit:
```md
â–¶ npm run release:minor
```

d.) Major patches after using a `BREAKING CHANGE: ` commit:
```md
â–¶ npm run release:major
```

5.) A nicely formatted list full of changes should appear in the root directory called `CHANGELOG.md`!
